# qnserver.conf: Config file for the DAQ server          #
#                                                        #
#                Blank lines, whitespace, and anything   #
#                after a '#' is ignored. Any random      #
#                config file can be specified by a -f    #
#                switch to the server program. Other-    #
#                wise the server looks for qnserver.conf #
#                in it's local directory, and then in    #
#                $HOME/.qnserver.conf and then looks in  #
#                /etc. Options specified in this file    #
#                will override the program defaults,     #
#                but can be overridden in turn by any    #
#                options passed on the command line.     #
#                (run ./cardServer -h to see options)    #
#                Caveat: white/black list addresses on   #
#                the command line are ADDED to any IP    #
#                addresses that are present in here.     #
